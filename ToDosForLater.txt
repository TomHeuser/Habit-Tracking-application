short term:
look into sql:
    refine history table
    move setup-data to json file and consider how to split data from json into tables
    change seeding procedure
    rename functions that implement predefined habits and data to sth. like seed_habits() and seed_history_data()
    get rid of hard deleting and replace with soft deleting to prevent orphan data - maybe drop the idea of a delete()
        function as set_active() will do the trick of soft "deleting"

medium term:
create test for classes.py
create test for db_setup.py
create test for db.py

long term:
remove user input from class tree, once cli is working, to preserve clean architextural separation
move initial predefined habits from db.py to da_setup.py and initial_data.json and add 4 week example data


"longest" term on finishing up phase 3:
delete scribble.py
