short term:
look into sql:
    move setup-data to json file and consider how to split data from json into tables
        transfer code from new seeding procedure into db_setup.py and db.py
    refine history table

medium term:
once database basics are finished ----- change dates to something sensible (ask in ILSE)
create test for classes.py
create test for db_setup.py
create test for db.py
get rid of hard deleting and replace with soft deleting to prevent orphan data - maybe drop the idea of a delete()
        function as set_active() will do the trick of soft "deleting"

long term:
add 2nd class tree containing history class to hold information necessary for analytics
remove user input from class tree, once cli is working, to preserve clean architextural separation
move initial predefined habits from db.py to da_setup.py and initial_data.json and add 4 week example data


"longest" term on finishing up phase 3:
delete scribble.py
